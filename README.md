# REGRESSION-ON-TRAINING-DATATSET
Welcome to the Mini Project REGRESSION ON TRAINING DATASET. This project mainly focused on Regression, EDA, Feature Engineering, Checking the data is normally distributed and Evaluating metrics for regression Algorithm. Through interactive Visualizations transforming raw data into actionable Intelligence that drives accurate Decision Making.
